@title[#:version "1.0"]{Behavioral Models}
@author[(author+email "Simon Johnston" "johnstonskj@gmail.com")]

This package provides a number of modules that provide behavioral models. These
models, state machines, petri nets, Markov chains, etc. can be used to analyze
or simulate real-world systems or act as a test surrogate for components in
complex systems as they are developed.

@defmodule[behavior/fsm]

This module provides the ability to define, and then execute, state machines
using a flexible yet capable model. The definition model provides a @italic{state
machine} that contains a set of discrete @italic{states}, each state has a set
of outbound @italic{transitions} each of which may be associated with a
@italic{trigger event}. Note, wherever possible the terminology and relationships
in the state machine  model follow those of the
@hyperlink["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UML_state_machine"]{Unified Modeling
Language (UML)}.


State machine definition details:

@itemlist[
  @item{All state names, and events, are represented as symbols.}
  @item{Behaviors are represented as simple procedures that take the current
        @racket[machine-execution] as a parameter and return void. As the
        execution instance is immutable the behavior cannot affect the
        current state.}
  @item{Transition guards are represented as simple predicates that take the
        current @racket[machine-execution] as a parameter and return a boolean
        which indicates whether the transition is @italic{enabled}. As the
        execution instance is immutable the behavior cannot affect the
        current state.}
  @item{Additional events may be passed into the model, these will be recorded
        if received and will be ignored without error. See execution details
        below for event and transition behavior.}
  @item{The model supports @italic{internal transitions} that transition from
        one state to itself without triggering exit or event behavior(s).}

]

A state machine is executed by constructing a @racket[machine-execution] and then
calling @racket[execution-start]. This will transition to the start state and
perform any behaviors associated with it. The state machine only transitiona from
one state to another in response to an event (via @racket[handle-event]) or by
state completion (via @racket[complete-current-state]). The state machine is completed
when it transitions into either a @racket['final] state, or a state with no
outgoing transitions.

Additional execution details:

@itemlist[
  @item{A new execution has a condition @racket['created], and will not accept
        @racket[handle-event] or @racket[complete-current-state] calls until in
        condition @racket['active].}
  @item{The call to @racket[execution-start] will alter the condition to
        @racket['active] and set the current state to the start state.}
  @item{Once the execution completes the condition is set to @racket['complete]
        and the state machine will again reject calls to  @racket[handle-event]
        or @racket[complete-current-state].}
  @item{When handling an event (if the event is valid for this machine) if no
        transition leaving the current state is triggered by the event it is
        logged and ignored. If more than one transition is triggered by the
        event @italic{and} they are all enabled an error occurs and the
        execution condition is set to @racket['in-error].}
  @item{Similarly, when calling @racket[complete-current-state] if no transitions are
        enabled at this time, or if multiple transitions are enabled, an error
        occurs.}
  @item{The last two situations are considered temporary, while the machine
        indicates an error the actions can be re-tried if a different event
        is used, or of guard conditions evaluate to different results. In the
        case where a single transition is enabled on retry the execution
        condition is reset to @racket['active].}
  @item{Reporters are supported that receive events from the running execution
        for logging or other behavior.}
  @item{Limitations (compared to UML for example):
        @itemlist[
          @item{The procedure @racket[handle-event] is synchronous, no queue is
                provided for incoming events.}

@section[]{Module behavior/markov-chain}
@defmodule[behavior/markov-chain]

This module provides an implementation for (discrete-time, classic) Markov chains,
these can be used to create the underlying event stream, with specific distributions,
for higher-level behaviors, or for direct simulation. It also separates the
definition of a @racket[mkchain] from an execution instance so that the definition
may be reused across multiple executions. Individual states are represented as
symbols, the chain is represented as a matrix, with a row representing transition
sources and columns representing the transition target. Probabilities are represented
as real numbers from 0.0 to 1.0 and all probabilities in a row must add up to
either 0.0 or 1.0.

As defined by @hyperlink["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain" "Wikipedia"];
A Markov chain is "@italic{a stochastic model describing a sequence of possible
events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained
in the previous event}".

@examples[ #:eval example-eval
(define a-chain (make-chain 'example
                 (==> 'a (--> 'a .5) (--> 'b .25) (--> 'c .25))
                 (==> 'b (--> 'a .5) (--> 'c .5))
                 (==> 'c (--> 'a .25) (--> 'b .25) (--> 'c .5))))
(define an-exec (make-chain-execution a-chain 'b))
(execute an-exec 10)
(displayln (execution-trace an-exec))
(displayln (mkchain->graph-string a-chain))
]

The @racket[execution-trace] function returns the history of the execution as a
list of states the execution has been in. The list is ordered from most recent to
last; this trace is not a memory, the implementation is still a @italic{classic}
Markov chain.

An execution takes place according to discrete steps. At each step the set of

a single transition based on the probabilities for each. Once chosen the @italic{to}
state is made current and the step is complete.

If the current state is an @italic{absorbing} state (see @racket[>--<?]) then the
execution is said to be complete (see @racket[execution-complete?]) and any further
calls to either @racket[execute] or @racket[execute-next] will have no effect.

 to a transition or vice versa, never between places or between transitions. The
 places from which an arc runs to a transition are called the
 @elem[#:style plain]{input places} of the transition; the places to which arcs
 run from a transition are called the @elem[#:style plain]{output places} of the
 transition.}

According to the same definition "@italic{...the execution of Petri nets is
nondeterministic: when multiple transitions are enabled at the same time,
they will fire in any order}". To achieve this, at each step in the execution
a single random enabled transition is chosen to fire.

@section[]{Module behavior/reporter}
@defmodule[behavior/reporter]

This module provides a set of functions that construct @racket[reporter] functions
used be the models above. Effectively, each of the behavior models will emit
@racket[history-event]s that correspond to changes in the execution state.

To this end the @italic{make-?-execution} functions will take a @italic{reporter}
optional parameter. In general, if no reporter is specified, the null
(@racket[make-null-reporter]) reporter is used.

@defstruct*[history-event
  ([time real?])
            #:transparent]{
These events are sent to a reporter function to denote an action taken place
within a behavior execution. These structures cannot be created directly,
it is intended as the parent of behavior-specific history events.}

@defproc[(make-null-reporter)
         (-> history-event? void?)]{
Creates a reporter that consumes all events and does nothing.
}

@defproc[(make-buffering-reporter
          [selector (-> history-event? any/c)])
         (values (-> list?)
                 (-> history-event? void?))]{
This function creates a reporter that buffers all the events sent to it. It
returns two values; the first if a function that returns the current buffer
as a list, the second is the @racket[reporter] function itself. The @racket[selector]
function is called to buffer a subset of the passed event, else the entire event is
buffered.
}

@defproc[(make-channel-reporter)
         (values channel? (-> history-event? void?))]{
Returns two values; the first is a newly created @racket[channel] and the
second is a @racket[reporter] function that will accept events and write them to
this channel. 
}

@defproc[(make-logging-reporter
          [a-logger logger? (current-logger)])
         (-> history-event? void?)]{
Returns a @racket[reporter] function that will accept events and write them to a
standard racket @racket[logger].
}

@defproc[(make-port-reporter
          [port output-port?])
         (-> history-event? void?)]{
